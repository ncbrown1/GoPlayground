# Introduction - GoLang

.br-corner[![baby](gophers/baby.jpg)]

> Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

* Statically typed
* Built-in concurrency support
* Standardized formatting via `go fmt`
  * As a result, most GoLang code looks the same!
  * Good for collaboration
* Like C or C++, but without "extraneous garbage" and unsafe pointer operations
* Go "Runtime" included in binaries with GC, concurrency, stack management, etc.
  * Not a VM like Java

---

# GoLang Playground

.bl-corner[![gopherswrench](gophers/gopherswrench.jpg)]

A Web service that compiles + executes arbitrary Go code, returning program output

* Original GoLang PlayGround
  * [https://play.golang.org/](https://play.golang.org/)

* Simple Operations
  * Edit - Write code in [GoLang](https://golang.org/)
  * Run - Send code to server, get back program output or compiler errors
  * Format - Take your ugly code and send it back to you with good format
  * Share - Share your bad program with your friends

---

name: objective

# Problem?

.br-corner[![bupher](gophers/bupher.png)]

* The GoLang Playground already exists! Why do we need to remake it???

--

* Current version has restrictions
  * Limited CPU, RAM
  * No Network Access
  * No File System Access

* Concurrency, Networking &rarr; key strengths of GoLang

* Restrictions are half-addressed in Playground
  * Fake Time
  * Fake File System
  * Fake Network

---

# What do we want?

.tr-corner[![sticker](gophers/sticker.png)]

* To address current version's restrictions
  * Limited CPU, RAM &rarr; Unlimited?
  * No Network Access &rarr; Network Access
  * No File System Access &rarr; FS Access

* But restrict the increased capability to logged-in users

# Architecture

.tl-corner[![gopherhelmet](gophers/gopherhelmet.jpg)]
.left-column[![Go Playground Architecture](go-playground.jpg)]

.right-column[
1. JavaScript Client communicates HTTP/WebSocket with Front-End to display output
2. Front-End receives user input via HTTP/WebSocket and delivers output from Back-End RPCs to Client

   a. Caches redundant inputs to prevent overload

3. Back-End receives RPCs to compile + execute user programs; returns program output or compiler errors
]

---

# Architecture - Client

.br-corner[![gopherhelmet](gophers/gopherhelmet.jpg)]
.left-column[![Go Playground Architecture](go-playground.jpg)]

.right-column[
The JavaScript client chooses HTTP or WebSocket interface for running GoLang code and receiving outputs

* **HTTP** - Output is gathered and sent back in one response
* **WebSocket** - Output is sent to the client as it is generated

Timing is preserved via output delays from JSON response.

* Recall: time is fake on server side
    * All programs start at `2009-11-10 23:00:00 +0000 UTC`
* Output is separated into timed chunks
* To the user, it looks like program is run in real time
]

---

# Architecture - Front-End

.bl-corner[![gopherhelmet](gophers/gopherhelmet.jpg)]
.left-column[![Go Playground Architecture](go-playground.jpg)]

.right-column[
Receives client code, dispatches RPCs, sends translated output and compiler errors back to client

* _Caches_ program outputs so that redundant inputs don't overwhelm the system
* _Decodes_ output from the Back-End and sends output back to the client with playback info

Mostly trivial &mdash; just a routing/translation component
]

---

# Architecture - Back-End

.tl-corner[![gopherhelmet](gophers/gopherhelmet.jpg)]
.left-column[![Go Playground Architecture](go-playground.jpg)]

.right-column[
Receives small goroutines to _compile_ and _execute_.

* _Compiles_ user code into `NaCl`.red[*] executables
* _Executes_ compiled code
* Returns encoded.red[**] output or compilation errors in response

Ensures safe execution of arbitrary code in sandboxed environment (NaCl)

* Compiles differently to fake Time, Network, and FS

.footnote[
.red[*] Google's Native Client, discussed in next slide

.red[**] Encoded for timed playback
]

name: implementation

# NaCl - Google Native Client

.br-corner[![pirate](gophers/pirate.png)]

Originally designed to permit the safe execution of x86 programs inside web browsers

* Implements sandbox environment for 32-bit x86, 64-bit x86, and 32-bit ARM
* Arranges assembly instructions in a verifiable way to disable certain functions
* Typically the job of the linker &mdash; most higher-level packages can stay the same
  * `syscall` package re-implemented for `NaCl`

It is essentially a new operating system providing its own execution environment

* Includes custom OS features â€” syscall, malloc, threads, signals, etc.
* No access to pipes, networking, file system
* A simulated clock starting at Unix time 1257894000

Unsupported, but available: `PNaCl` &mdash; Portable Native Client
* Portable bytecode format for `NaCl` based on LLVM

???

Note about 64-bit x86, where NaCl adjustment is also required of compiler and runtime
* pointers are only 32 bits wide
* disallows the use of register R15
* and disallows the use of multi-register addressing modes

# Handling Processes

.tr-corner[![cowboy](gophers/cowboy.png)]

```go
type Message struct {
    Id   string // client-provided unique id for the process
    Kind string // "stdout", "stderr", "end"
    Body string
}

// Process represents a running process.
type Process struct {
    id   string          // user-defined process ID
    out  chan<- *Message
    done chan struct{}   // closed when wait completes
    run  *exec.Cmd       // the command running; Kill method is available
}
```

* Keeping track of these objects lets us manage runtime
* Program output is wrapped in `Message` struct
* Convert `Message` to/from JSON using Go `encoding/json` package

???

Users and system can kill process

Messages from out are sent over WebSocket Connections

# Timing: Front-End &#x2194; Client

.bl-corner[![biplane](gophers/biplane.jpg)]

```go
func main() {
    stop := time.After(3 * time.Second)
    tick := time.NewTicker(1 * time.Second)
    defer tick.Stop()
    for {
        select {
        case <-tick.C:
            fmt.Println(time.Now())
        case <-stop:
            return
        }
    }
}
```

```sh
2009-11-10 23:00:01 +0000 UTC
2009-11-10 23:00:02 +0000 UTC
2009-11-10 23:00:03 +0000 UTC

Program exited.
```

???

This is what the client sends and receives
* the lines are each separated by a second

# Networking

.bl-corner[![run](gophers/run.png)]

Restrictions on network input and output

* Can use loopback interface (127.0.0.1)
  * Listening for connections
  * Making requests
* Requests to any other hosts will fail horribly

---

name: contribution

# My Contribution

.tl-corner[![viking](gophers/viking.jpg)]

* Replicated all existing functionality of the GoLang Playground
  * Removed dependency on Google Cloud
  * Enable both WebSocket + HTTP communication
* Added User Login + Sign-up
* For logged-in users, add enhanced functionality
  * Instead of `NaCl`, use regular `go build`
  * Run compiled binary under `chroot` environment and clean up afterwards
  * Still have timeout, albeit a bit longer
      * people shouldn't host websites or mine bitcoin on my playground
  * Don't cache outputs
  * Require WebSocket communication for enhanced functionality
